# Unexpected Null Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unexpected behavior when handling null values as function arguments.

The `foo` function doesn't explicitly handle null values, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the application. This could cause silent failures, incorrect calculations, or other issues that might be difficult to debug.  The solution provided shows how to correctly handle the null values, providing more robust and predictable code.

## Bug

The original `foo` function fails to gracefully handle `null` values passed as arguments. This lack of explicit error handling can lead to unexpected results or silent failures later in the code's execution.

## Solution

The improved version explicitly checks for `null` values and provides clear error handling or alternate behavior.
